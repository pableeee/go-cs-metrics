## 1. Overall Snapshot

| Metric | CT | T | Total |
|--------|----|---|-------|
| Matches | 21 | 17 | 38 |
| Rounds | 412 | 357 | 769 |
| K / A / D | 375 / 117 / 269 | 317 / 96 / 262 | 692 / 213 / 531 |
| K/D | **1.39** | **1.21** | **1.30** |
| HS% | 35.7% | 40.7% | 37.9% |
| ADR | **114.2** | **119.0** | **116.3** |
| KAST% | **77.9%** | **76.8%** | **77.4%** |
| Entry K / D | 46 / 30 | 37 / 27 | 83 / 57 |
| Entry win rate | **60.5%** | **57.8%** | **59.3%** |
| Trade kills | 68 | 50 | 118 |
| Trade deaths | 58 | 54 | 112 |
| Flash assists | 3 | 3 | 6 |
| Utility damage | 2142 | 1445 | 3587 |
| Unused util/round | 0.24 | 0.20 | 0.22 |

**Headline numbers:** An ADR of 116.3 and a 59% entry win rate mark a high-impact, aggressive rifler. The 1.30 K/D understates the output — the ADR is elite for MM level and the volume of damage dealt every round is the most telling sign of consistent presence.

## 2. CT Side — What the Numbers Say

### 2.1 Strengths

**KD 1.39 — clear positive impact.**
With 375 kills in 412 rounds, you are almost at one kill per round on CT. This is the profile of a player who holds positions effectively and wins duels.

**Entry win rate 60.5% (46K vs 30D).**
On CT, entry events happen when opponents run into held positions or when you take aggressive peeks. A 60.5% win rate on those duels is very strong — you are winning more than 3 out of 5 of the highest-stakes individual exchanges of each round.

**Trade kills 68, trade deaths 58 — net positive.**
You are converting trade kills more than you are giving them up. This means that when teammates die near you, you punish it. Strong CT anchor and retake discipline.

**KAST breakdown (407 round-stat rounds):**

| Component | Count | % of rounds |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Kill rounds | 235 | 57.7% |
| Assist rounds | 102 | 25.1% |
| Survive rounds | 145 | **35.6%** |
| Traded rounds | 30 | 7.4% |
| KAST total | 323 | **79.4%** |

The **35.6% survival rate** on CT is a strong signal. Combined with the high kill count, this means you are not just fragging recklessly — you are also holding alive when the round is under control. A player with pure aggression would have a survival rate closer to 20%.

**Utility damage 2142 across 412 rounds (5.2/round avg).**
This is solid. You are using HE grenades and Molotovs effectively on CT — whether that's molly-blocking B rushes on Inferno or HE combo on a known stack.

### 2.2 Weaknesses

**Low flash assists (3 total in 412 rounds).**
This is the sharpest red flag. You are almost never flashing for teammates. On CT, coordinated flashes are how you catch peeking attackers and enable retakes. Three flash assists across an entire season means utility usage is almost entirely selfish (damage and area denial) rather than team-enabling.

**Unused utility 0.24/round on CT.**
More than one in five rounds you end with a grenade you never threw. On CT, buying utility and banking it is acceptable in some situations (eco baiting) but 0.24 average suggests a habit of not committing grenades when they would matter most — late-round retake moments especially.

---

## 3. T Side — What the Numbers Say

### 3.1 Strengths

**ADR 119.0 — highest side.**
Your T-side damage output slightly exceeds CT. This is unusual; most players deal more on CT because they hold held angles and punish rushers. Your T-side ADR being higher suggests you are executing well and getting deep into sites before dying.

**HS% 40.7% (vs 35.7% CT).**
Headshot percentage rises on T because AK-47 is the dominant rifle and T-side duels often happen at medium range with crouching/counter-strafing enemies. 40.7% HS with the AK is a sign of good aim discipline — you are not spraying at bodies.

**Trade deaths 54 — team is cleaning up after you.**
On T, 51 rounds (from per-round stats) your death was traded by a teammate. This is a very high number and is actually meaningful — it means your aggressive entries are creating value even when you die. You open the door, teammate walks through.

### 3.2 Weaknesses

**KD 1.21 — lower than CT.**
The 0.18 gap between sides is real and significant. Over 357 rounds, you are dying more relative to your kills on T. The pattern in the per-match table makes this concrete: several T-side Mirage results show KD of 0.63, 0.81, 0.85 against the average 1.21. On Mirage T-side specifically you are struggling.

**Trade kills 50, trade deaths 54 — net negative.**
This is the inverse of CT. On T, you are being traded more than you are trading. The mechanism: you are likely the first player through on executes, dying, and the team trades — but you personally are not converting the trades when your teammates die first. You are giving value as bait but not extracting value as a trader. This is the signature of a **first-entry** player rather than a **second-entry** trader.

**Survival rate 26.2% (95/362) — 9 points lower than CT.**
Expected on T but worth tracking. Very few rounds where you hold enough to be alive at round-end.

**Flash assists 3 (same as CT) — again, nearly zero.**
Pop-flashing for your own peek is fine, but you should be generating flash assists on site executes. Flashing through smoke for the second player in is one of the highest-impact things a first-entry player can do.

## 4. Weapon Breakdown

### 4.1 Primary weapons

| Weapon | K | HS% | DMG | Hits | DPH |
|--------|---|-----|-----|------|-----|
| AK-47 | 295 | 36.9% | 35,505 | 949 | 37.4 |
| M4A1 | 134 | 32.8% | 16,971 | 519 | 32.7 |
| Galil AR | 50 | 36.0% | 6,747 | 223 | 30.3 |
| FAMAS | 35 | 25.7% | 3,806 | 153 | 24.9 |
| M4A4 | 35 | 20.0% | 3,666 | 128 | 28.6 |

**AK-47 is your best weapon by a large margin.** 295 kills and 37.4 DPH. The HS% of 36.9% means roughly one in three AK kills is a headshot, which is solid for a rifler who is not just spray-fishing — but see the pro comparison below.

**M4A1 preferred over M4A4** (134 vs 35 kills). This makes sense — the M4A1 silencer is more forgiving in position-revealing scenarios and you prefer the accuracy/recoil tradeoff.

**Galil AR at 50 kills** — you are buying this weapon regularly on partial-buy rounds rather than defaulting to a pistol. 30.3 DPH is lower than AK but the volume of use shows you do not force-buy as recklessly as many players.

**FAMAS 24.9 DPH — concerning.** The FAMAS has a distinct burst pattern. The low DPH suggests spray usage rather than burst discipline. Either switch to the Galil (slightly better at range) or learn the FAMAS burst mechanic deliberately.

### 4.2 Pistol game

| Pistol | K | HS% | DPH |
|--------|---|-----|-----|
| Desert Eagle | 40 | 57.5% | 62.0 |
| Glock-18 | 32 | 62.5% | 30.5 |
| USP-S | 27 | 63.0% | 38.0 |

This is an excellent pistol profile. The Desert Eagle at 57.5% HS and 62 DPH means you are buying it on eco and converting. USP-S HS% of 63% is elite — headshot discipline on the CT pistol rounds is a real edge. This pistol confidence is a competitive differentiator; many players at this level struggle to convert eco rounds.

### 4.3 The AWP problem

| | bennett | ZywOo | torzsi | m0NESY |
|-|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| AWP kills | 4 | 21 | 21 | 13 |
| AWP deaths | 31 | — | — | — |
| AWP DPH | 110 | 154.7 | 165.4 | 108.9 |

**You have 31 AWP deaths and only 4 AWP kills.** This ratio reveals a pattern: you are repeatedly losing AWP duels, either by peeking wide and getting picked, or by holding an angle and getting one-tapped. The 31 deaths specifically means opponents are regularly winning AWP duels against you across 38 games. This is a training priority — either learn to avoid AWP angles (utility, off-angles, wide peeks) or develop consistent counterpeeking technique.

### 4.4 Utility usage

| Type | K | Damage | Hits |
|------|---|--------|------|
| HE Grenade | 5 | 3,009 | 192 |
| Molotov | 0 | 407 | 106 |
| Incendiary | 0 | 171 | 58 |

HE grenades are contributing meaningful damage (3,009 total) and even the occasional kill. Molotov/incendiary usage is present. But as noted, flash throws are essentially absent from your game — 3 flash assists in 769 rounds is near-zero.

## 5. Map-by-Map

| Map | Matches | Rounds | K/D | ADR | KAST% | Entry K/D | Trade K/D |
|-----|---------|--------|-----|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Nuke | 11 | 241 | 1.32 | 112.6 | 75.5% | 28/17 | 43/38 |
| Inferno | 10 | 208 | 1.27 | 117.1 | 78.4% | 19/18 | 26/31 |
| Mirage | 7 | 134 | 1.18 | 111.8 | 81.3% | 13/11 | 16/18 |
| Overpass | 4 | 79 | 1.33 | **144.6** | 77.2% | 12/4 | 20/13 |
| Ancient | 3 | 50 | **1.59** | 101.6 | 72.0% | 5/3 | 9/3 |
| Dust2 | 1 | 23 | 1.31 | 124.1 | 69.6% | 1/1 | 1/3 |
| Anubis | 1 | 21 | 1.33 | 118.6 | 76.2% | 3/3 | 3/6 |
| Vertigo | 1 | 13 | 2.00 | 95.6 | 92.3% | 2/0 | 0/0 |

**Best map: Overpass.** The 144.6 ADR is substantially higher than every other map. Entry K/D of 12/4 (75% win rate) is dominant. The trade K/D of 20/13 is also positive. Overpass rewards aggressive mid control and wide peeks — that fits your style.

**Most played: Nuke (11 matches).** 1.32 KD and 112.6 ADR on Nuke is solid but not your ceiling. Nuke is a map where CT side utility is extremely important (retake molly on B, smokes for ramp/door). If your utility usage improves, Nuke could match your Overpass output.

**Weakest: Mirage (1.18 KD, 81.3% KAST).** The KAST is actually good, but KD and ADR are your lowest among main maps. Individual match results on Mirage T are 0.85, 0.81, 0.63 — there is a clear T-side Mirage wall. Mid control on Mirage T requires specific smoke/flash setups; without those, A-site and B-site executes become very difficult.

**Inferno trade K/D 26/31 — the only map with negative trade balance.** Inferno B-site retakes and A-site pushes favor teams that trade reliably. You are losing trades on Inferno, which means opponents are winning 2-for-1 exchanges. This is likely linked to the low utility usage — uninformed retakes on Inferno without molly/flash lead to exactly these losing trades.

## 6. Pro Player Comparison

The 10 pro demos cover Falcons vs NAVI (Ancient, Inferno) and mouz vs Vitality (Nuke, Train, Inferno). The pro player numbers represent elite-level benchmarks.

### 6.1 ADR comparison

| Player | Role | ADR | KD | KAST% |
|--------|------|-----|----|-------|
| **m0NESY** | AWP/Star | 160.9 | 2.42 | 86.5% |
| ZywOo | AWP/Star | 122.8 | 1.37 | 77.6% |
| ropz | Lurk/Anchor | 102.6 | 1.51 | 81.6% |
| flameZ | Entry | 102.3 | 1.10 | 73.7% |
| xertioN | Second rifle | 97.3 | 0.96 | 67.1% |
| apEX | Entry/IGL | 83.1 | 0.83 | 67.1% |
| torzsi | AWP | 90.8 | 1.09 | 76.3% |
| **bennett** | — | **116.3** | **1.30** | **77.4%** |

Read this carefully: **bennett's ADR of 116.3 sits between ZywOo and m0NESY**, above every rifler in this pro sample. This does not mean parity with pro players — it means your damage output profile is aggressive and consistent, comparable in pattern to elite-level stars. The difference is in execution under pressure, map reading, and team coordination — not raw damage numbers.

For context: flameZ (Vitality entry fragger) has 102.3 ADR with a 1.10 KD. Your ADR is 14 points higher at 1.30 KD. Your KAST of 77.4% also matches ZywOo's 77.6%.

### 6.2 Entry comparison

| Player | Entry K | Entry D | Win rate |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| m0NESY | 12 | 1 | **92.3%** |
| ropz | 10 | 2 | **83.3%** |
| ZywOo | 8 | 3 | 72.7% |
| xertioN | 10 | 16 | 38.5% |
| apEX | 7 | 9 | 43.8% |
| flameZ | 10 | 15 | 40.0% |
| **bennett** | **83** | **57** | **59.3%** |

You attempt entries at much higher volume than any pro player in this sample (83 entries vs ~10-12 for most pros over roughly comparable round counts). A 59.3% win rate is genuinely strong. Compare it to flameZ at 40% or apEX at 43.8% — both professional entry fraggers who die opening more than they win. Your rate exceeds both of them.

Note that xertioN at 38.5% is considered the team's second-rifle / lurk player and he attempts a lot of entries — the low win rate is acceptable at pro level because it creates space. The fact that you win yours at 59% means you are not being reckless; you are taking winnable duels.

### 6.3 AK-47 headshot comparison

| Player | AK HS% | AK DPH |
|--------|--------|--------|
| flameZ | 75.0% | 48.0 |
| ropz | 70.6% | 45.7 |
| Spinx | 76.5% | 44.1 |
| ZywOo | 63.2% | 47.6 |
| apEX | 71.4% | 47.2 |
| xertioN | 59.1% | 43.4 |
| **bennett** | **36.9%** | **37.4** |

This is the sharpest gap between you and pro riflers. Professional AK players are producing **HS% of 59–76%** and **DPH of 43–48**. Your 36.9% HS and 37.4 DPH means you are hitting more body shots and dealing less damage per bullet. At pro level, the AK kills most enemies with a single headshot tap or 2–3 chest shots. Your lower DPH means more bullets to finish kills — which is directly related to survival; the longer a duel lasts, the more likely you are to also get hit.

This is the **number one mechanical training priority**: AK-47 headshot percentage. Every percentage point toward 50%+ reduces the rounds needed to secure a kill, reduces counter-fire received, and raises your K/D passively.

### 6.4 Trade kill comparison

| Player | Trade K | Trade D | Net |
|--------|---------|---------|-----|
| torzsi | 14 | 8 | +6 |
| ropz | 9 | 8 | +1 |
| xertioN | 10 | 9 | +1 |
| flameZ | 9 | 7 | +2 |
| apEX | 7 | 14 | -7 |
| **bennett CT** | **68** | **58** | **+10** |
| **bennett T** | **50** | **54** | **-4** |

CT trade net of +10 is excellent. T trade net of -4 is marginal. The pattern matches a player who anchors strong positions on CT (punishing trades) but plays a first-in role on T (getting traded rather than trading). The good news: the negative T-side trade balance is modest and aligns with how entry fraggers play at every level.

## 7. Role Fit Analysis

Based on all data, there are three plausible roles:

### Role A: Aggressive Anchor / Second AWP (CT) + Entry Fragger (T)

**Evidence for:**
- CT KD 1.39, survival 35.6%, trade net +10 — fits an anchor who holds and wins duels
- High KAST on CT (77.9%) means consistent round presence when holding
- T entry rate 57.8% fits a first-through player
- Good pistol game enables clutch exits on eco rounds
- AK-47 volume is an entry rifler's profile (high bullets-fired, high kill rate)

**Evidence against:**
- Flash assists near zero — anchors need to re-flash retakes, entry players need pop flashes

**What this role demands from you:**
Pick one or two CT positions to master per map, learn the specific re-flash and retake grenades for those positions, and continue the aggressive CT duel-seeking behavior. On T, focus on coordinating the pop-flash for the player behind you instead of solo entry.

---

### Role B: Support / Trade Player

**Evidence for:**
- KAST% of 77.4% is the signature of a high-impact round-presence player
- Assists (213 total) show you are in fights alongside teammates
- CT trade kill discipline (+10 net) shows retake awareness

**Evidence against:**
- Flash assists of 6 across 769 rounds is incompatible with a support role
- ADR of 116 means you are the damage dealer, not the setup maker
- Entry kill volume (83 attempts) is an aggressor pattern, not support

This role does not fit your current data.

---

### Role C: Star Rifler / Solo Player

**Evidence for:**
- ADR 116 exceeds pro riflers in the dataset
- Entry win rate 59% exceeds professional entry fraggers
- Desert Eagle / USP / Glock headshot rates are strong
- Overpass ADR 144 — when the map is right you are dominant

**Evidence against:**
- AK HS% (37%) lags pro standards by 20–30 percentage points
- T-side Mirage results show a ceiling that drops sharply on structured maps
- Low assist count on T (96) relative to kill count (317) — not drawing enough value from team setups

---

### Recommended focus: **Role A** with specific upgrades

You are naturally an aggressive anchor on CT and entry fragger on T. The data supports this strongly. The upgrades needed are:

1. **AK-47 headshot rate → 50%+.** Practice single-tap and burst at head height. Use aim training maps. Every AK kill should ideally be a two-tap or one-tap. This is the single highest-leverage mechanical improvement available.

2. **Add 2–3 flash assists per match.** Learn the pop-flash for your most-played positions (A short Nuke, B-site Inferno, mid Overpass). One well-timed flash that opens a kill for a teammate has higher team impact than an extra solo kill on a won round.

3. **AWP evasion.** 31 AWP deaths across 38 games is systematic. Map-specific: learn which angles AWPers hold on your most-played maps and route around them with utility or wide peek timing.

4. **T-side Mirage structure.** Your Mirage T results are the clearest weak spot. This is not a mechanics issue (your mechanics are good) — it is map-specific execution. Learn two or three complete Mirage T-side round setups (smokes + flashes for A-main, B-short, mid connector) and run them deliberately.

5. **Convert unused utility.** 0.22 grenades banked per round. When you survive a round, ask: was there a position I should have molotov'd or smoked? Building this habit converts the 0.22 unused into both damage and flash assists.

## 8. Summary

| Category | Rating | Comment |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Rifle output (ADR) | Elite | 116.3 ADR, top of pro sample range |
| Entry aggression | Strong | 59% entry win rate, high volume |
| CT anchor | Strong | 1.39 KD, 35.6% survival, +10 trade net |
| T entry | Solid | 57.8% entry rate, high trade deaths (team converts) |
| Pistol game | Strong | Deagle/Glock/USP all above 57% HS |
| AK mechanics | Average | 36.9% HS vs 60–75% at pro level |
| Utility for team | Weak | 6 flash assists in 769 rounds |
| AWP resistance | Weak | 31 deaths vs 4 kills, clear systematic loss |
| Map pool | Solid | Strong on Nuke/Inferno/Overpass; T-Mirage needs work |

The profile is consistent: a high-damage aggressive rifler who wins individual duels at an above-average rate, provides genuine entry value both when winning and when dying, but needs to develop team utility usage and close the AK headshot gap to reach the ceiling that the ADR numbers suggest is achievable.
